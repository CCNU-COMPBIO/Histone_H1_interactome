This repository contains human histone H1 interaction data derived from structural and chemical cross-linking studies.
All files can be opened with Cytoscape 3.7.0 or higher versions.
You can browse the following folders and files:
cross_linking_H1_interaction_residue_level: Source data and Cytoscape files for the cross-linking-based H1 interactome at the residue level.
2. structure_H1_interaction_residue_level
Source data files for the structure-based H1 interactome at the residue level.
3.network_default_node_topological
Source data for topological analysis of human histone H1 interaction networks derived from structural and cross-linking data, including additional network layers.
4. PTM_data: Source data containing post-translational modification (PTM) information on histone H1 interaction interfaces.
5.cross_linking_and_structure_interaction_protein_level.xlsx: Integrated interaction data at the protein level, combining information from both cross-linking and structural interactomes.
6. cross_linking_and_structure_interaction_protein_level.cys: Cytoscape session file for visualizing and analyzing the protein-level histone H1 interactome.
