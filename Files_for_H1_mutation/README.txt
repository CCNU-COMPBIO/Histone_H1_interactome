This folder contains curated datasets of human histone H1 mutations, compiled from public mutation databases and literature sources.
All files are provided in .xlsx format and can be opened with Excel or any spreadsheet software.

Files and Descriptions

1. cbioportal_mutation_data.xlsx
Raw mutation data of histone H1 genes obtained from the cBioPortal database.

2. driver_mutation_data.xlsx
List of histone H1 driver mutations identified in a recent publication based on large-scale cancer genomics datasets.

3. Recurrent H1 mutations.xlsx
List of recurrently observed mutations (appearing in multiple patient) in histone H1 genes.

4. Putative H1 driver mutations.xlsx
Integrated dataset combining information from driver_mutation_data.xlsx (recent literature) and Recurrent H1 mutations.xlsx.

5. Putative_H1_driver_mutations_mapping_to_interaction_network.xlsx
Mapping of putative driver mutations to the histone H1 interaction network, linking mutation sites to potential effects on protein–protein interfaces.
